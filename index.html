        <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        Humans usually describe the color concept through color categories like green, white or red. Since color is one of most distinguishable 
        visual features for human perception, there is a need to develop models which are able to deal with color in tasks such as image analysis [<a href="#ref_1">1</a>],
        linguistic interaction [<a href="#ref_2">2</a>], or visual scene description [<a href="#ref_3">3</a>], [<a href="#ref_4">4</a>], [<a href="#ref_5">5</a>].
        Colors are represented by numerical triplets in color spaces. This representation is too different from the way humans describe color,
        given by color names associated to subsets of resemblant precise colors [<a href="#ref_6">6</a>], [<a href="#ref_7">7</a>], and hence not well suited to
        capture the human’s perception of color categorization [<a href="#ref_8">8</a>]. Moreover, color is blurred by nature: there is a progressive and blurred 
        transition between different colors categories [<a href="#ref_9">9</a>], [<a href="#ref_10">10</a>], [<a href="#ref_11">11</a>] 
        (e.g., where is the limit between the red color and the orange one?).
        In addition, these categories are subjective and context-dependent [<a href="#ref_12">12</a>], [<a href="#ref_13">13</a>], that is,
        the criteria under which we judge color resemblance are not only perceptual, but also depend on the person and the context.
        </p>
        <p>
        In order to deal with these issues, fuzzy colors and fuzzy color spaces [<a href="#ref_14">14</a>] have been proposed as a suitable way for modelling human color categories.
        Recent approaches are based on defining three-dimensional membership functions on the color space domain. Prototypes, which represent color categories,
        are often used in this type of techniques. In order to obtain the membership degree, the distance to these prototypes are calculated. Others methods are included in this
        category such as those inspired by the membership functions proposed in fuzzy clustering techniques (e.g., fuzzy c-means) [<a href="#ref_33">33</a>]. A different way of obtaining the membership function, not 
        based on clustering-like membership functions, is proposed in [<a href="#ref_34">34</a>], where the membership degree is defined by means of a linear function on the basis of the Euclidean distance to the prototype. A more recent
        approach [<a href="#ref_14">14</a>] propose a technique for representing color categories by means of a fuzzified Voronoi tessellation of the color space. It is based on the theory of conceptual spaces [<a href="#ref_35">35</a>], [<a href="#ref_36">36</a>] plus a fuzzifying methodology to obtain a Voronoi-based function for each single fuzzy color. Techniques in 
        this last group allow to model any color term, whose membership functions are less restrictives than in the previous proposals.
        <p>
        Nevertheless, in some cases the membership function for a color category is not convex. Commonly, this fact occurs when there are IS-A relationships, where a color category
        is composed by the union of a set of subcategories. For example, crisp colors in the category "light green" are also in the "green" category, thus it is possible to define the 
        fuzzy set associated to the "green" category as the union of the fuzzy sets for "light green", "dark green", etc. However, the union of their membership function for the category
        "green" could yield a non-convex membership function, even when each subcategory is modelled by a convex fuzzy set.
        In [<a href="#ref_46">46</a>], the authors propose the notion of granular fuzzy color to address this problem, defined as aggregation of basic ones (the so-called granules).
        This methodology builds a fuzzy color (a granule) from a set of prototypes, where each granule corresponds to
        a subcategory of the color category, and the membership
        function is defined on the basis of the distance to those
        prototypes. Finally, to create each granule, a sphere-based membership function
        is used in [<a href="#ref_46">46</a>].
        </p>
        <p>
        In this paper we illustrate the idea of a granular fuzzy color and a granular fuzzy color space in an interactive way. We propose several interactive elements,
        where the reader can understand the different steps to build granular fuzzy colors and granular fuzzy color spaces. Furthermore, these elements allow the user
        to build and test his/her own granular fuzzy colors in a simple and intuitive way. For this purpose, the sphere-based granular fuzzy colors are used for a better
        understanding: it is a simple approach but very powerful.
        </p>
        <p>
        The paper is organized as follows. In section II, the idea of a granular fuzzy color will be introduced, where it will be explained
        through two interactive elements. The first element shows to the reader a granular fuzzy color with a single granule; the second element 
        illustrates to the reader the idea of a granular fuzzy color with several granules. Both elements allows the reader the selection of his/her
        own sets of prototypes to build the fuzzy colors. Section III describes the methodology to build granular fuzzy color spaces. Again, two interactive elements are proposed
        to illustrate the idea of a granular fuzzy color space where each fuzzy color is composed by one granule and by a set of granules. In Section IV it is showed some experimental
        results over natural images. Then, an interactive element where the reader can load and test his/her own image. Finally, conclusions and future work are described in Section V.

      <h2 id="granularfuzzycolors">II. Defining granular fuzzy colors</h2>

      <p class="inline-math">Let us consider the set of crisp colors that can be represented in a computer using any crisp color space $$\Gamma$$.
      A fuzzy color is the computational representation of a color term; formally [<a href="#ref_14">14</a>]:</p>

      <p class="inline-math">
      <b>Definition II.1.</b> A fuzzy color $$\tilde{C}$$ is a linguistic label whose semantics is represented as a normal fuzzy subset of colors.
      </p>
      <p class="inline-math">
      As it is proposed in [<a href="#ref_14">14</a>], imposing the use of normal membership functions implies that for each fuzzy color $$\tilde{C}$$
      there is at least one crisp color $$\bold{r}$$ such that $$\tilde{C}(\bold{r}) = 1$$.
      </p>

      <p>There is a specific case of fuzzy color: the so-called granular fuzzy color, which is defined in [<a href="#ref_46">46</a>] as the union of other fuzzy colors:</p>
      <p class="inline-math">
        <b id="def-granular">Definition II.2.</b>
        A fuzzy color $$\tilde{C}$$ is said to be granular iff there exists a finite set of fuzzy colors $$\{\tilde{C}_{1}, \ldots, \tilde{C}_{m}\}$$,
        called granules, such that</p>
        <p class="inline-math" style="text-align: center;">
          $$\tilde{C} = \cup_{i=1}^{n}\tilde{C}_{i}$$
        </p>
        <p class="inline-math">
        with the union performed on the corresponding membership functions via a t-conorm $$\bigoplus$$.
      </p>

      <p>
        As we have introduced before, the granular approaches to fuzzy color modeling are used in this paper, which have shown to be more suitable
        than non-granular ones [<a href="#ref_46">46</a>]. To define granular fuzzy colors, three-dimensional membership functions on the color space domain will be proposed.
        In particular, we will use membership functions on the basis of parametric functions of the distance to prototypes [<a href="#ref_14">14</a>], [<a href="#ref_34">34</a>].
        It is intuitive for the human perception the use of prototypes to describe basic color categories. There are some works in the color naming field 
        [<a href="#ref_37">37</a>], [<a href="#ref_38">38</a>] which provide prototypes associated to color categories on the basis of human color perception.
      </p>

      <p class="inline-math">
        Let $$\bold{p_{i}} \in \Gamma$$ be a crisp color prototype and let $$\lambda_i \in \mathbb{R}^{k_i}$$ be a set of 
        $$k_i$$ parameters related to the kind of membership function used. 
        Let $$P = \{p_1, \ldots, p_n\}$$ and $$\Lambda = \{\lambda_1, \ldots,\lambda_n\}$$ with $$n \geq 1$$.
      </p>

      <p class="inline-math">
        <b>Definition II.3.</b>
        A fuzzy color $$\tilde{C}$$ is a granular fuzzy color of the form:</p>
        <p class="inline-math" style="text-align: center;">
          $$\tilde{C}(\bold{c};P,\Lambda) = \bigoplus_{1 \leq i \leq n}{\tilde{C_{i}}(\bold{c}; \bold{p_{i}}, \lambda_{i})}$$
        </p>
        <p class="inline-math">
          with $$\bigoplus$$  being a t-conorm, and where $$\tilde{C_{i}}(\bold{c}; \bold{p_{i}}, \lambda_{i})$$ 
          is defined as:
      </p>
      <p id="def-fuzzy-color" class="inline-math" style="text-align: center;">
        $$\tilde{C}(\bold{c};\bold{p_{i}}, \lambda_{i}) = f(\|\bold{c}-\bold{p_{i}}\|; \lambda_{i})$$
      </p>
      <p class="inline-math">
        with $$\bold{p_{i}} \in \Gamma$$  being a crisp color prototype, $$\|·\|$$ being the Euclidean distance and 
        $$\bold{c}$$ being the crisp color to be analyzed. 
        The function $$f : [0, +\infty] \rightarrow [0, 1]$$ is a non-increasing function satisfying $$f(0) = 1$$.
      </p>
      <p class="inline-math">
        There are many different types of functions $$f$$ [<a href="#ref_46">46</a>], [<a href="#ref_46">48</a>] that can be used for defining a fuzzy color, being the
        most employed the sphere-based ones and the polyhedron-based ones [<a href="#ref_14">14</a>]. In this paper we will focus on the
        sphere-based, since it is a simple but powerful approach. In particular, the following function $$f$$ , with parameters $$\lambda = (a, b)$$,
        is used [<a href="#ref_34">34</a>]:
      </p>
      <p id="def-sphere-mf" class="inline-math" style="text-align: center;">
        $$f(x; a,b) = 
        \begin{cases}
          1,  & x < a, \\
          \frac{b-x}{b-a},  & a \leq x \leq b, \\
          0,  & x > b 
        \end{cases}
        $$
      </p>
      <p class="inline-math">
      The parameter $$a$$ represents the radius of the sphere centered around the prototype $$\bold{p_{i}}$$, where colors are fully 
      representative of the color category (having membership 1). The parameter $$b$$ is the radius of the sphere centered
      around $$\bold{p_{i}}$$ containing all colors which are compatible to some extent (having membership greater than 0) with the 
      color category. Membership decreases linearly with the distance to $$\bold{p_{i}}$$ when $$a \leq x \leq b$$, corresponding to points 
      between the surfaces of both spheres. 
      </p>

      <p class="inline-math">
        An interactive element to understand how a granular fuzzy color is modelled is included in Fig. <a href="#simple-fig""">1</a>. Here, it is showed 
        a RGB cube where a granular fuzzy color with a single granule is represented. As we have described previously, it is needed
        a set of prototypes $$P$$ and a set of parameters $$\Lambda$$ for building a granular fuzzy color $$\tilde{C}$$. In this case,
        $$P = \{\bold{p}_1\}$$ and $$\Lambda = \{\lambda_1\} = \{(a_1, b_1)\}$$ since the granular fuzzy color $$\tilde{C}$$ 
        built is made up with only a granule, i.e., $$\tilde{C}(\bold{c};P,\Lambda) = \tilde{C_{1}}(\bold{c}; \bold{p_{1}}, \lambda_{1})$$.
      </p>
      <p class="inline-math">
        Within the RGB cube two elements are showed: the granular fuzzy color $$\tilde{C}$$ (the purple spheres) and
        a crisp color $$\bold{c}$$ (the green tetrahedron) to evaluate in the fuzzy color. For the granule which compose the fuzzy color,
        three elements are showed: first, the prototype $$\bold{p}_1$$ as a solid point in the center of the spheres; second,
        a internal sphere with a radius of $$b_1$$, which represents the kernel of the fuzzy color; finally, a external sphere
        with a radius of $$a_1$$, which illustrates the support of the fuzzy color. On the right side, we can see several
        interactive elements where we can change the parameters and interact with the figure.
      </p>
      <p class="inline-math">
        By default, the interactive element
        builds $$\tilde{C}$$ through the prototype $$\bold{p}_1 = (154, 78, 174)$$
        and the parameters $$a_1 = 15$$ and $$b_1 = 30$$, but these values can be modified through the pickers on the right side.
        In the default case, it is showed that the point to evaluate $$\bold{c}$$ is outside of the fuzzy color spheres, thus 
        the membership degree is 0. If we change the value of $$b_1$$ from 30 to 110 growing up the support and reach $$\bold{c}$$,
        we can observe that the membership degree has now a value of 0.09, since the point $$\bold{c}$$ is now within the support.
        We can also change the value of $$a_1$$ from 15 to 90 and see how the kernel grows up. Due to this change, $$\bold{c}$$ is now
        nearer from the kernel and the membership degree reach a value of 0.43. If the kernel reach the point $$\bold{c}$$
        (change $$a_1$$ value to 110 too), the membership degree has the maximum value since $$\bold{c}$$ is now inside of the 
        kernel sphere. We want to highlight the fact that, in this experiment, although the membership degree increases because 
        we force to the point $$\bold{c}$$ to be within core or support, the distance keeps the same value.
      </p>

      <p class="inline-math">
        We can also move the point $$\bold{c}$$ to analyse how it affects to the membership degree and to the distance.
        For example (assuming that $$a_1$$ and $$b_1$$ parameters has 15 and 30 values, respectively), we can move it to the 
        (164, 74, 191) RGB coordinates. Here, $$\bold{c}$$ has a membership degree of 0.66, since
        it is closer to $$\bold{p}_1$$ (distance changes from 101.42 to 20.22). If we pick a closer $$\bold{c}$$ to the prototype
        $$\bold{p}_1$$ (for example, (152, 82, 173)), we can see that distance decrease to 4.58 and membership degree reach a value
        of 1 (note in the RGB cube that $$\bold{c}$$ is inside of the kernel sphere).
        In this experiment, instead of modifying $$a_i$$ or $$b_i$$ parameter, we are changing the position of the point
        to evaluate $$\bold{c}$$ to see how increase (decrease) the membership degree (the distance), numerically and visually.

      <p class="inline-math">
        In order to get a deeper vision of the granular fuzzy colors, another interactive element is introduced in Fig. <a href="#granular-fig""">2</a>. Here, it is showed 
        a RGB cube where a granular fuzzy color with three granules are drawed. As we have described previously, it is needed
        a set of prototypes $$P$$ and a set of parameters $$\Lambda$$ for building a granular fuzzy color $$\tilde{C}$$. In this case,
        $$P = \{\bold{p}_1, \bold{p}_2, \bold{p}_3\}$$ and $$\Lambda = \{\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3\} = \{(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), (a_3, b_3)\}$$ 
        since the granular fuzzy color $$\tilde{C}$$ 
        built is made up by three granules, i.e., $$\tilde{C}(\bold{c};P,\Lambda) =  
          \tilde{C_{1}}(\bold{c}; \bold{p_{1}}, \lambda_{1}) \oplus
          \tilde{C_{2}}(\bold{c}; \bold{p_{2}}, \lambda_{2}) \oplus
          \tilde{C_{3}}(\bold{c}; \bold{p_{3}}, \lambda_{3})$$.
        About the t-conorm $$\oplus$$, we use maximum function for this experiment.
      </p>
      <p class="inline-math">
        Within the RGB cube, again, two elements are showed: the granular fuzzy color $$\tilde{C}$$ (the three purple spheres) and
        a crisp color $$\bold{c}$$ (the green tetrahedron) to evaluate in the fuzzy color. For each granule $$\tilde{C}_i$$ three elements are showed:
        first, the prototype $$\bold{p}_i$$ as a solid point in the center of the spheres; second,
        a internal sphere with a radius of $$b_i$$, which represents the kernel of the granule; finally, a external sphere
        with a radius of $$a_i$$, which illustrates the support of the granule. On the right side, we can see several
        interactive elements where we can change the parameters and interact with the figure.
      </p>
      <p class="inline-math">
        By default, the interactive element
        builds each $$\tilde{C}_i$$ through the prototypes $$\bold{p}_1 = (154, 78, 174)$$, $$\bold{p}_2 = (194, 81, 225)$$,
        $$\bold{p}_3 = (170, 81, 225)$$ and the parameters $$a_i = 15$$ and $$b_i = 30$$ (i.e., the same parameters for the three granules),
        but these values can be modified through the pickers on the right side.

        In the default case, it is showed that the point to evaluate $$\bold{c}$$ is outside of the three granules spheres, thus 
        the membership degree is 0. If we change the value of $$b_i$$ from 30 to 50 growing up the supports,
        we can observe that the membership degree has now a value of 0.09, since the point $$\bold{c}$$ is now within the support of one of the granules.
        We can also change the value of $$a_i$$ from 15 to 40 and see how the kernels grows up. Due to this change, $$\bold{c}$$ is now
        nearer from the kernel of one of the granules and the membership degree reach a value of 0.31. If one of the kernels reach the point $$\bold{c}$$
        (change $$a_i$$ value to 47 too), the membership degree has the maximum value since $$\bold{c}$$ is now inside of one of the 
        kernel spheres. We want to highlight that we are using max as t-conorm, thus if $$\bold{c}$$ is in at least one granule the membership degree will
        be greater than 0. Furthermore, note that in this experiment, although the membership degree increases because 
        we force to the point $$\bold{c}$$ to be within a core or support, the distance keeps the same value.
      </p>

      <p class="inline-math">
        In this experiment, we can also move the point $$\bold{c}$$ to analyse how it affects to the membership degree and to the distance.
        For example (assuming that $$a_i$$ and $$b_i$$ parameters have 15 and 30 values, respectively), we can move it to the 
        (203, 70, 206) RGB coordinates. Here, $$\bold{c}$$ has a membership degree of 0.42, since
        it is closer to $$\bold{p}_2$$ (minimum distance changes from 60.17 to 23.73). If we pick a closer $$\bold{c}$$ to the prototype
        $$\bold{p}_2$$ (for example, (203, 70, 220)), we can see that distance decrease to 15.07 and membership degree reach a value
        of 1 (note in the RGB cube that $$\bold{c}$$ is inside of the kernel sphere of $$\tilde{C}_2$$).
        In this experiment, instead of modifying $$a_i$$ or $$b_i$$ parameter, we are changing the position of the point
        to evaluate $$\bold{c}$$ to see how increase (decrease) the membership degree (the distance), numerically and visually.

      <h2 id="results">III. Building granular fuzzy colors</h2>

      <p class="inline-math">
      In the previous section, we have introduced the granular fuzzy color idea: it is defined on the basis of a set of color prototypes $$P$$.
      This set of positive prototypes are fully representative of the color term modelled by the 
      fuzzy color (i.e., their membership to the fuzzy color is 1.0). To emphasize this feature of $$P$$, from now
      on we will note it as $$P^+ = \{\bold{p_1}, \ldots , \bold{p_n}\}$$. Furthermore, for the building process, we will also consider
      prototypes representing the complement of the color term we want to model. Let $$P^− = \{\bold{np_1}, \ldots , \bold{np_m}\}$$,
      with $$m \geq 1$$, be a set of negative prototypes, satisfying $$P^+ \cap P^− = \emptyset$$. Negative prototypes can be 
      obtained in several ways. In particular, when color categories are disjoint in semantics, the negative 
      prototypes for a certain color category include the positive prototypes for the rest of color categories.
      </p>
      <p class="inline-math">
        We need to learn $$\lambda_i = (a_i , b_i )$$ to build a granular fuzzy color, which are related to the parameters of the function defined in Eq.(<a href="#def-sphere-mf">3</a>),
        that is, the radius of the core and the support. To estimate these parameters a simple procedure will be used 
        [<a href="ref_46">46</a>]: the sphere associated with the support of each $$\tilde{C}_i$$ is expanded until it reaches
        some negative prototype. In this way, we can see the negative prototypes as the “limiters” of the growth of the support
        of the granular color $$\tilde{C}$$ (given by the union of the individual supports).
      </p>
      <p class="inline-math">
        Thus, let $$D_i$$ be the distance from $$\bold{p}_i$$ to its nearest point in the set
        $$P^−_i = P^− \cup P^+\textbackslash\{\bold{p}_i\}$$. Note that $$P^−_i$$ is the set of prototypes employed to limit the
        growth of the granule $$\tilde{C}_i \in \tilde{C}$$, that include both the negative prototypes of $$\tilde{C}$$ and the
        positive prototypes of the rest of granules that form $$\tilde{C}$$. Then, $$\lambda_i$$ is obtained as follows
        [<a href="ref_46">46</a>]:
      </p>
      
      <p id="def-lambda" class="inline-math" style="text-align: center;">
        $$\lambda_i = (a_i, b_i) = (\alpha_i D_i, \beta_i D_i)$$
      </p>

      <p class="inline-math">
        with $$\alpha_i \in [0, 1)$$ and $$\beta_i \in (0, 1]$$ being scale factors for the core radius and the support radius,
        respectively, satisfying $$\alpha_i < \beta_i$$. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="inline-math">
      The concept of fuzzy color space [<a href="ref_14">14</a>] arise when we need to work with several color terms,
      as for example in some practical applications of color modelling. A fuzzy color space 
      $$\tilde{\Gamma} = \{\tilde{C}_{1}, \ldots, \tilde{C}_{m}\}$$ is a set of fuzzy colors defined on a certain
      crisp color space $$\Gamma$$. In our case, each $$\tilde{C^k} \in \tilde{\Gamma}$$ is a granular fuzzy color
      composed by the union of color granules. Let $$\tilde{C^k_i} \in \tilde{C^k}$$ be the
      i-th granule of the granular fuzzy color $$\tilde{C^k} \in \tilde{\Gamma}$$. The learn of fuzzy colors parameters is a advisable way
      to build fuzzy color spaces, since several color categories should be modelled.
      </p>
      
      <p class="inline-math">
      In order to understand the granular fuzzy color building process, an interactive element is showed in Fig. <a href="#fcs-fig""">4</a>.
      Here, it is showed a RGB cube where a set of granular fuzzy colors are drawed (i.e., a fuzzy color space).
      As we have described in this section previously, it is needed a set of positive prototypes $$P^+$$ and a set of negative prototypes $$P^-$$ to learn $$\lambda_i = (a_i , b_i )$$ and build the granular fuzzy color $$\tilde{C}_i$$. 
      This example shows how learn these parameters for a set of granular fuzzy colors which represents several color categories. For the sake of simplicity, each granular fuzzy color is made up with only a granule (i.e., we need only a positive prototype to build each fuzzy color). Our starter point is a set of prototypes
      $$P$$, so we use each $$\bold{p}_i \in P$$ as the positive prototype and $$P\textbackslash\{\bold{p}_i\}$$ as the set of negative prototypes. This fact will grow the sphere associated of each granular fuzzy color until it reach another kernel of some another color category.
      </p>
      <p class="inline-math">
      Within the RGB cube a set of granular fuzzy colors are showed (the colorful spheres). For each granular fuzzy color three elements are showed:
      first, the prototype $$\bold{p}_i$$ as a solid point in the center of the spheres; second,
      a internal sphere with a radius of $$b_i$$, which represents the kernel of the granule; finally, a external sphere
      with a radius of $$a_i$$, which illustrates the support of the granule. Note that these parameters are learned in this case. On the right side, we can see several interactive elements where we can change the parameters and interact with the figure.
      </p>

      By default, the interactive element
      builds the granular fuzzy color space through the basic ISCC-NBS prototypes [<a href="#ref_39">39</a>]. In particular, here we are using the core set of 13 basic color categories (see Fig. <a href="#iscc-nbs-fig">3</a>), made up of 10 hue names (pink, red, orange, brown, yellow, olive, yellow-green, green, blue, violet, purple) and three neutral ones (white, gray, and black). In this example, we can verify that there is no fuzzy color support that intersects with the kernel of another fuzzy color, since given a prototype $$\bold{p}_i$$ the prototypes of the rest of categories $$P\textbackslash\{\bold{p}_i\}$$ (i.e., the negative prototypes) act like "limiters" of the growth of the support sphere.

      This interactive element also allows the creation of a custom granular fuzzy color space. For example, we could create a granular fuzzy color space of four color categories: red, green, blue and black. Our set of prototypes would be $$P = \{(255, 0, 0), (0, 255, 0), (0, 0, 255), (0, 0, 0)\}$$, respectively. It is showed that each prototype is drawed in four corners of the RGB cube. If we look at black fuzzy color, we can see that the support sphere grows up until it reach the red, green and blue kernel spheres. This behavior also happens in the rest of fuzzy colors.

    <p>
      Once we have illustrated the basics ideas of the granular fuzzy color, Fig. <a href="#granular-fcs-fig">5</a> shows another interactive element illustrating a granular fuzzy color space where each fuzzy color is composed by a set of granules. In this case, the color categories modelled are the following: pink, red, brown, yellow, olive, yellow-green, green, blue, gray, white and black. For each color category, we use as positive prototypes the ones corresponding to the some modifiers from the ISCC-NBS [<a href="#ref_39">39</a>], that is, the subset of prototypes in the ISCC-NBS complete set associated to the basic color category for the given modifiers; and as negative prototypes the prototypes from the ISCC-NBS basic set corresponding to all color categories except the itself color category modelled (see Fig. <a ref="#iscc-nbs-fig">3</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Each color category could have different number of granules defining the granular fuzzy color. For example, on the one hand, if we select the color category "blue", we can see a set of 6 granules corresponding to specific color categories of the ISCC-NBS complete set: "Vivid Blue", "Strong Blue", "Brilliant Blue", "Deep Blue", "Very Light Blue" and "Light Blue". With all these tonalities, we are modelling the color category "blue" in a richer way (color subcategories range from lighter ones to darker ones, covering a bigger set of blue tonalities).
      On the other hand, if we select the color category "black", we can see the opposite case where we have just a granule to model this category.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this figure, where we are modelling granular fuzzy color with more than one granule, we can also check the constraint explained previously: there is no granular fuzzy color support that intersects with the kernel of another granular fuzzy color, not even in the granules of the same granular fuzzy color.

      <p>
        In this section, the ability of the granular fuzzy colors to represent colors and their several tonalities is analysed. For this reason, a comparison between non-granular fuzzy colors and granular fuzzy colors are proposed through qualitative experiments. Two interactive elements have been developed and proposed in this section to perform these experiments. By default, an natural image with high variability in color tonalities are proposed to test  granular fuzzy colors, but the reader could load his/her own image to test them.
      </p>

      <p class="inline-math">
        In order to show how a particular fuzzy color model a color category, the following method is proposed: given an image, the membership degree to a given fuzzy color of each pixel is calculated. Then, these membership degrees are used as transparency degree (alpha channel) in the original image. Note that membership degree with a value of 0 corresponds to maximum transparency and, therefore, shows the background color that, in this case, is the white; on the other hand, membership degree with a value of 1 corresponds with non-transparency and, therefore, shows the original color of the image pixel. This color mapping allows us to see the colors "selected" to some degree by the model, thus it is expected that it shows the areas of the image for the given color category.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the following interactive elements, by default, a natural image of a flag waving in the wind is showed, although the read could load his/her own image example. In this image, six dominant colors can be labeled: "red" (the two side strips of the flag), "white" (the middle strip of the flag, flag stick and the clouds), "blue" (the sky), "green" and "yellow" (the middle flag details). There are two relevant causes to use this example: on the one hand, there are different subcategories of red (corresponding to the waves in the flag) which are related by an IS-A relationship; on the other hand,
        there is a lot of variation within the same hue due to the shape of the waves in the flag and the light reflection on
        their surfaces. By default, the explained mapping is showed on the right side for the "red" color category.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fig. <a href="#results-fcs-fig">6</a> shows an interactive element where a non-granular fuzzy color space is represented on the left side. It is built through the basic ISCC-NBS prototypes [<a href="#ref_39">39</a>]. As in previous examples, here we are using the core set of 13 basic color categories (see Fig. <a href="#iscc-nbs-fig">3</a>), where each of them is used as the positive prototype needed to build a non-granular fuzzy color. The rest positives are used as negative prototypes for this non-granular fuzzy color. In the mapping image for the "red" color category, it is showed that this approach is not able to model the variability of the red colors in the folds of the flag. The non-granular techniques do not detect the shadow areas corresponding to different types of red, like "light red" or "dark red" (there are "holes" in the mapping image), working well only in the cases of "vivid red" regions.
        If we select "blue" color category through the selector, it is showed a similar effect: there are a lot of sky zones where the membership degree to the non-granular fuzzy color corresponding to the "blue" category is too low ("holes" in the mapping image).

      <p>
        These experiments allow us to conclude some interesting ideas: the granular approach selects almost all the pixels (i.e., it
        gives high membership degree to all the color category pixels), while the non-granular techniques leave many "holes" (i.e., they
        give zero or very low membership degrees to many pixels). This is due to single-prototype based models are less accurate than granular
        ones and so, in this particular case, they leave out some crisp colors in the models of "red" and "blue" that,
        as a consequence, are not captured by the model in the examples.
      </p>

      <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions and future work</h2>

      <p>
        In this paper, interactive figures has been developed in order to dive the user in an experimental experience. In this case, the notion of granular fuzzy color has been introduced to represent color categories. The concept of granule is explained in an incremental way in two interactive figures: first, granular fuzzy colors with only a granule; second, granular fuzzy colors with several granules. These figures allow the user to change prototypes and parameters for a better understanding of the fuzzy color concept.
      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, based on the proposed definition, a methodology for building granular fuzzy colors has been described. The interactive elements for this theorical method are also two: first, a simpler granular fuzzy color space can be built allowing the user to select the prototypes for each color category; second, a complex granular fuzzy color space is build through a predefined set of prototypes, where 13 color categories are represented. In both figures, the parameters needed to build each fuzzy color are learned automatically. By the use of these figures, the reader can get details about the building process and even create his/her own fuzzy color spaces.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some qualitative experiments have been performed in order to analyze the ability of the described methodology to represent colors and their different tonalities. For this reason, a comparison between non-granular fuzzy colors and granular fuzzy colors are proposed. Non-granular approaches are not able to model the hue variations of given
        color categories; this behavior is expected since non-granular techniques do not consider subtypes of
        tonalities in their models. On the other hand, the granular approach described in this paper has correctly
        captured the colors of the images, including their various subcategories. In this paper, two interactive elements are proposed to perform this comparison. The reader can test his/her own images examples in both approaches and see the results.
      </p>

      <p>
        This paper, where interactive figures are within the paper itself, allows the reader to immerse in the approach proposed. They make easier to understand complex concepts through simple and visual figures, allowing the reader to change parameters and interact with the theory in a practical way.
      </p>
      
      <p class="inline-math">
        Our future work will follow two lines: first, the study of other functions f in Eq.(<a href="#def-sphere-mf">4</a>), particularly the case
        of Voronoi cells, and distances in other color spaces. As we have explained, the sphere-based case is used because
        it is simple and facilitates the explanation of the proposal but, in addition, because the combination allows
        complex models. The Voronoi-based function in [<a href="#ref_14">14</a>] is expected to avoid
        the mentioned limitation, at the cost of working with a more complex model. Let us remark that a fuzzy color 
        space $$\tilde{\Lambda}$$ could be built by using any crisp
        color space $$\Lambda$$ (RGB, LAB, etc.) as reference set. The interactive elements proposed in this paper should be extended to this complex functions too.
        </p>
      <p class="inline-math">
        Second, a method to automatically learn the set of prototypes $$P$$ in a given context will be studied. There are some works in literature trying to solve this problems [<a href="#ref_47">47</a>], where a set of clustering-based techniques are proposed for non-granular fuzzy colors. To address the granular fuzzy color case, new clustering-based techniques will be needed in order to model the IS-A relationships. New interactive elements should be designed and implemented to understand how these clustering-based techniques work and how the set of prototypes is extracted.
